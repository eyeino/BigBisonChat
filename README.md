# BigBisonChat

## Overview

This is the backend for the BigBisonChat React client. I wrote it to run all the chat services I want, and so I can use any type of client in the future, relying on HTTP requests and some type of Websocket implementation. Please see the README for the [React client](https://github.com/eyeino/BigBisonChat-React).
